Hypertext markup language(HTML)

HTTP is the protocol we use to retrieve the documents
HTML is the format of those documents when they are retrieved

HTML was really tolerant. You could have tags that didn't finish and have all kinds of things.
But nowadays, HTML is more professional, more clear.
It has standards defined by an organization called the Worldwide Web Consortium or the W3C that comes out of MIT. This takes care of standart for all the World Wide Web(WWW).

Standarts defined:
Tags have to be lowercase
All tags have to start and stop
If you have an attribute, it's got a double quotes around it and browsers will still tolerate all kinds of mistakes.

most of your files that are HTML files with a .htm suffix.

Absolute references always begin with the protocol name. An absolute reference is the complete address to a web page.
Relative references are used when your website includes more than one page. You might choose to have several pages and a link mechanism for moving among them.
